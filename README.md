**Intern Information:**

Name: Puppala Deepika

Intern ID: COD4488

**Task Description:**

The task assigned to Puppala Deepika during CodTech IT Solutions Internship program is to Use Maltego GUI based tool and Gather Information about the given target site.
Target : http://testphp.vulnweb.com/

**Installation and Setup:**

Download the appropriate version of Maltego from the official website.

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Upon launching Maltego for the first time, create a new account or log in with existing credentials.

Configure any necessary settings, such as proxy configurations or API keys for data sources.

**Understanding Maltego Interface:**

Palette: Contains various entities and transforms that can be used for data mining.

Graph View: Main workspace where entities are represented as nodes and relationships as edges.

Detail View: Displays detailed information about selected nodes or edges.

Transform Hub: Access to various data sources and transforms for fetching information.

**Using Maltego for Gathering Information:**

Entity Selection: Begin by selecting an appropriate entity type from the palette. For example, "Website" or "Domain."

Search and Add Entity: Enter the target website or domain name into the search bar and add it to the graph.

Running Transforms: Right-click on the added entity and select "Run Transform." Choose relevant transforms to gather information such as WHOIS data, DNS records, or social media profiles associated with the target.

Visualizing Connections: Maltego will display the retrieved information as interconnected nodes and edges, providing a visual representation of relationships.

Expand and Explore: Continue to expand the graph by adding related entities and running additional transforms to uncover deeper connections and insights.
